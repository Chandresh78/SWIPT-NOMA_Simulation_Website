## 📌 Abstract

This project focuses on analyzing the performance of dynamic power allocation in SWIPT-enabled cooperative NOMA wireless networks. The goal is to optimize energy harvesting and transmission efficiency using simulation models.

We simulate scenarios using MATLAB for signal and network analysis while the front-end interface demonstrates results and theory on the web using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
